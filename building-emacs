First get the official emacs source.
Installing Emacs from the Official Sources
Get the official Emacs (insert version) source package:
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/#Obtaining

Unpack it to create the emacs-(insert version) directory.  Then run these commands in Terminal:
  tar xf emacs-(insert version).tar.xz
  cd emacs-(insert version)
  ./configure --with-ns
  make
  make install

Your Emacs.app is now in emacs-(insert-version)/nextstep/Emacs.app.  Locate this in Finder, then drag it to your Applications folder. I personally called it Emacs2 to distinguish between the original pre-compiled version in case it didn’t ‘make’ properly.
